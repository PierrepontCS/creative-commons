            Holding a piece of printer paper reading “Allie + E” aloft, Hannah waited as waves of mothers, sisters,
            brothers searched through the crowd around her and were quickly snatched away. Eventually their flight came touching down
            right at the time pre-ordained. Then there was a searching as she tried to make out their two now unfamiliar faces in the
            crowd.
            <br>
            He had grown even fatter. At the age of thirty-something (what was it again? Thirty-five? Six?) he looked fifty.
            In his left hand was a large duffel bag and in his right the left of a small girl and the woman thought to herself that
            her daughter seemed almost another piece of luggage in the hand of the man. She shouted to them and jumped up and down
            and flapped her sign. The bustle of the airport about her like waves crashing on beaches.
            <br>
            His head on a swivel, her gaze directed firmly, they eventually looked at each other.
            He had no expression and leaned down and whispered to the girl and then pointed at her and then they both looked at her
            like a zoo animal and meandered over. Closer up Hannah could make out the new features of the tween
            (a term used by the marketing department) and the small girl was ten now and had grown lanky.
            She had freckles before, inherited from her mother, but now they had fused and faded into faint splotches.
            <br>
            There was a greeting and then Hannah squatted down to the small girl’s eye level and smiled. The small girl was so big now.
            <br>
            “You’re so big,” she said. The small girl just stared at her. At eye level Hannah stared into the small girl’s eyes and
            they were hollow like ping-pong balls.
            <br>
            They drove in her big 1999 Chevrolet Camaro which was painted blood red with black stripes as it always was and
            they drove to her big apartment which had a big garage and she took them to their bedrooms.
            The small girl had fallen asleep by the time they arrived. The man carried her to her bed.
            <br>
            Eventually there were familiar snores. The woman turned on the television and sat on the sofa.
            She breathed deeply and massaged her temples.
            <br>
            <br>
            He had called four months ago, in the winter. He had spoken in a voice firm but breath shaky and did not say much.
            He had called on a busy day and so he was held uncomfortably between her shoulder and her ear.
            <br>
            “Hey.” he said.
            <br>
            “You’ve reached Hannah Delacruz in marketing. What do you need me for?”
            <br>
            “It’s Ed.”
            <br>
            There was a pause.
            <br>
            “Ed.”
            <br>
            “Yes. It’s me.”
            <br>
            “Edward Wu.”
            <br>
            “Yes.”
            <br>
            A pause.
            <br>
            “I’m sorry for calling but this is urgent. I have to go on a business trip and it’s near where you live.
            I don’t want to leave Allie alone.”
            <br>
            “You want to stay with me.”
            <br>
            “I’m asking if you would be opposed to us staying with you.”
            <br>
            “I have work too, Ed. I can’t watch her all day.”
            <br>
            Sure. That’s fine. Allie’s a smart girl. You know that. I just don’t want her to eat frozen processed food.
            I’d like for her to eat warm meals and I don’t want her touching the stove.”
            “You can’t get home at night? You can’t find a babysitter?”
            <br>
            “These trips are exhausting on their own. I also have to get close to clients.
            That means drinking with them. Going to dinner with them. It’s important. And I don’t trust them.
            Babysitters. And they’re expensive these days. You know they can go for six hundred dollars a night now?”
            <br>
            “You know I’m not a good cook.”
            <br>
            “I know. But for dinner you can order takeout or something. She loves Chinese.
            For breakfast just fry a couple eggs or something. I don’t make too many eggs for her because I’m worried about cholesterol.
            But she loves eggs. It’ll be alright for just two weeks.” A pause.
            <br>
            “I can make eggs.”
            <br>
            “Yeah.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Sure enough the man was gone by the time Hannah had woken up on that somewhat warm summer morning.
            The sunlight was warm and came in blocks through the apartment’s big glass windows and she made her way to the
            kitchen and poured herself coffee. She headed back to her bedroom to shower.
            To her surprise she heard the somewhat sticky sounds of little bare feet against hardwood.
            Through the hallway the small girl emerged, pink, mouselike and yawning.
            <br>
            “Morning,” said Hannah. “You’re up early. It’s only seven.”
            <br>
            “Dad told me you wake up at seven.”
            <br>
            “It’s summer. You can stay up late if you want. Sleep in.”
            <br>
            “It’s okay.”
            <br>
            “Are you hungry? I was about to make a few eggs.”
            <br>
            The small girl perked up.
            <br>
            “Yeah. Can I have them fried?”
            <br>
            They fried seven eggs and Hannah ate three and the small girl ate two and a half.
            They were good though overcooked (“I like them,” said the girl, “A bit more when the yolk is still jiggly.”)
            and made with too much pepper. They waved goodbye and Hannah left for work.
            <br>
            “The gaining of weight is a manifestation of one’s inability to exert self control.
            How many grad students do you see fat like me?” She remembered him saying it verbatim.
            He had been moping over the unavoidable truth that he now possessed a double chin.
            She had comforted him, telling him how silly his worries were.
            <br>
            They had met sophomore year of college in Business Economics 201 and they had sat next to each other in the lecture hall.
            He was a stern looking second-gen immigrant whose hairline was receding unnoticeably and had a cotton-candy beard that for
            the life of him he could not grow out. She was a spike-haired punk taking after one of the many counter-cultural
            movements of the day which were legion and all indistinguishable from one another. Once they dated they looked like
            characters from a romantic comedy. This was a common joke she made introducing him to friends.
            <br>
            “Don’t we look like we could be on NBC?” she would say. Invariably the response would compare her and some popular
            buxom celebrity and him to a male counterpart. And she would beam.
            <br>
            During the proceedings her mother had put her wrinkled hand on Hannah’s shoulder and told her not to worry.
            “The courts,” she said, “rule almost always in the woman’s favor.”
            <br>
            <br>
            That night Hannah took the small girl out to a Chinese restaurant near where she lived which was decent and
            she ordered egg rolls for the girl and sweet and sour chicken for herself. The food came and they ate.
            In the middle of eating Hannah slapped her forehead.
            <br>
            “Oh my God,” she said. “I’m so sorry I completely forgot to get you lunch.”
            <br>
            “It’s alright. I ate eggs.”
            <br>
            “The eggs?”
            <br>
            “I microwaved them.”
            <br>
            “Ah. That’s good. I’m sorry.”
            <br>
            “It’s alright.”
            <br>
            The girl went back to her egg rolls and Hannah waved the waitress over again and ordered some egg noodles for take out.
            <br>
            “How’s school?”
            <br>
            “Good.”
            <br>
            “He tells me you’re already in seventh grade. That’s very impressive.”
            <br>
            A pause. “Thank you.”
            <br>
            “You aren’t picked on, right?”
            <br>
            “No.”
            <br>
            “Are you popular?”
            <br>
            “No.”
            <br>
            “Are they hard? The classes?”
            <br>
            The girl spoke through a full mouth.
            <br>
            “-O, I’f ‘earned ‘ost af da ings before-” she swallowed “-so it’s been easy.”
            <br>
            “Good. That’s good.”
            <br>
            <br>
            They had to balance child-rearing and their studies. To save money he elected to call his parents for help -
            they stayed with them in the dorms. After they graduated, after they joined the corporation, they moved far away,
            far from where his family could find him. With two the mortgage was manageable.
            <br>
            The small girl was named on a whim. Hannah did not like any of her family’s names and neither did the man and the two had
            been unable to come up with one even after the small thing passed into their world. As they watched the little breaths
            come out of the ratlike and bloody thing inspiration came.
            <br>
            “Allison,” she said.
            <br>
            “Allison?”
            <br>
            “Allison. Like Allison Janney.”
            <br>
            “Janney?”
            <br>
            “She’s an actress. She’s in, uh, a bunch of films and plays.”
            <br>
            “Never heard of her.”
            <br>
            “Never? We saw her on Broadway when we went, Ed.”
            <br>
            “That was years ago.”
            <br>
            “Just one year. Also, you said you loved it.”
            <br>
            “I did?”
            <br>
            “You did.”
            <br>
            Later, when Hannah would scream and the small girl was four or five or six she would run to the attic of the small
            house and scream down. After enough times the screaming became somewhat disingenuous but she still did so. A little actress.
            <br>
            <br>
            The weekend came again and still the man could not be with the girl and so the woman took the small girl in the big car
            out into the city. They ate McDonalds burgers for breakfast which the small girl did not like so she only ate fries.
            Afterwards the girl asked shyly if they could see the natural history museum which was famous and so they went there and
            marveled at beasts long gone, long forgotten. The small girl liked the flying dinosaurs with long and tedious names and
            so the woman bought the girl a stuffed replica.
            <br>
            She was in a good mood as they drove back to the apartment. But traffic was slow, as an accident had occurred somewhere
            on a main street, so they had nothing to do. Looking around, Hannah pointed something out to the girl.
            <br>
            “Look,” said Hannah. “That’s the hospital you were born in.”
            <br>
            The small girl looked and did not know what to say. “Really?”
            <br>
            “Yeah. I remember it perfectly. That window right there. Third row down, second window. That one.
            The nurse that day was really rude.”
            <br>
            “Ah.”
            <br>
            “When you were born you were so pink. It didn’t hurt at all. I don’t know why, but it didn’t hurt at all. You were so pink.”
            <br>
            The small girl didn’t say anything.
            <br>
            <br>
            Even if Hannah screamed at him, even if she was unreasonable and had to apologize sheepishly afterwards, h
            is smooth and unbearded face would be still and unmoving like a crab’s carapace, his eyes black and sunken like they
            were receding on stalks, and he would seem very small. One day he compressed so far as to turn his presence into a dense
            and microscopic kernel. She would see him at work with the face of some other man she could not recognize and then he would
            come home and be invisible somewhere perhaps upstairs or in the room adjacent. At times in the dining room he would
            appear suddenly to cook or to give concerns about the small girl’s schoolwork and extracurriculars,
            and rarely he would appear in their bedroom.
            <br>
            In those times she missed his un-presence. It was the way he phrased things to her, little gestures he acted like she
            could not see. It was the way he comforted the small girl with his hand on her shoulder and saying things that the
            woman could not hear, the way he’d pick his words to make himself seem omniscient, so that to deny his suggestions
            made the small girl twist in guilt and dread. In this way he turned the world against them.
            <br>
            Her mother had told her that there was a fundamental difference between women and men.
            “The weakness of women is expressed through sadness. In men it’s anger.” This was spoken to her one day when she
            was in her teens as she sat balled up and weeping on her bed.
            <br>
            “When women are weak they act weak because that’s expected, typical.
            When men are weak it means they have something to prove. So, anger. Rage.”
            <br>
            This is why her mother stayed with her father. He was a weak man and she a weak woman.
            <br>
            That night she could not sleep because of the constant car noise of the city and she saw him as a phantom passing
            through the big apartment. He stank heavily of alcohol and he first careened slowly towards the kitchen to rinse out
            his mouth and then lumbered to his bedroom dragging his body as if it were full of heavy mercury.
            She felt something towards this cheap-suited man but though they saw each other they did not speak,
            as there was no need to seem so polite to one another when not in the presence of a smaller being.
            <br>
            The next day they went out into the city again and this time ate at a fancy and hip gastropub which served burgers
            the small girl still did not like and so ate the sauerkraut instead. That day they went to the park in the city and
            walked around the green oasis like weary pilgrims.
            <br>
            Small birds like flying rats chirped and sang there in the greenery and there were mothers with their children and she
            thought there were few fathers.
            <br>
            They left the park and went to Hannah’s old university and there were students like rodents crawling about, scrambling
            to classes even on that holy Sunday. As she walked with the small girl she began to list off the buildings.
            There's the math department there's the science department there's the lecture hall. They headed to the dorms where
            the woman had stayed with the man but upon arrival there were no dorms but a great rectangular pile of refuse which
            stank like something in decay.
            <br>
            And when they entered the big car the small girl was sleepy and eyelids half open and breathing from her mouth.
            The girl crawled into the backseat and Hannah went to the driver’s. The engine purred. And then the woman was aware -
            aware of the boundlessness of the road, of the difficulty of finding a woman and her small child somewhere in the
            big United States with big money and a big car.
            <br>
            She drove. As she did the street turned uncongested and clear. A gentle snore in the backseat.
            <br>
            “Do you want to go somewhere for your birthday?” Hannah had asked when the girl turned eight.
            “We could go to the zoo. Or we could go to one of those game shops that you like.” The girl had shaken her head.
            Then he spoke.
            <br>
            “Don’t you want to go somewhere for your birthday? You’re only eight once.”
            <br>
            “I don’t want to.”
            <br>
            “Are you sure?”
            <br>
            “She doesn’t want to go anywhere.”
            <br>
            “We can take the day off of school if it’s your birthday.”
            <br>
            “It’s okay.”
            <br>
            “Do you want a party? Do you want to invite people over?”
            <br>
            “It’s okay.”
            <br>
            “Are you sure?”
            <br>
            “Am I-”
            <br>
            “I’m sure your classmates would like it.”
            <br>
            “Edward! The girl’s said no.”
            <br>
            “I’m-”
            <br>
            “You’re only eight once.”
            <br>
            They decided to have a party.
            <br>
            “Look,” he had said when the small girl had left the room. “I’ve been talking to her teachers.
            I’ve been talking to her counselor. She’s always in the corner. At this rate she’ll grow up lonely.
            We don’t want her to grow up lonely.”
            <br>
            “Why can’t you just respect her wishes?” Her voice began to get louder.
            “Why are you doing this? Why can’t you do anything for the family?”
            <br>
            “Look-” he had begun to say. But he could not get a word in because she had begun to scream at him and he receded once
            again. A small presence by the door. The walls of the room: thin, very thin.
            <br>
            At the hearing she had testimony from all their associates, all the teachers, family members, friends, carefully
            curated and shown to the court. The opponent’s evidence, presented tactfully by his lawyer: a complete album of his
            bruises, and an x-ray of a finger, shattered.
            <br>
            <br>
            The small girl in the backseat stirred unnoisily and looked about. The night itself had come but failed to gain ground
            on the city. The speckled army of stars - all gone now, all casualties that left a terrible black,
            or perhaps transported all about her.
            <br>
            “Where are we going?” she asked.
            <br>
            “We’re going back. I got lost.”
            <br>
            “Alright.”
            <br>
            And so she fell back asleep and they went back.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Thank you, Hannah. I hope we haven’t been a bother.”
            <br>
            And as she met his eyes it was like he was a stranger.
            <br>
            “Not at all.” She put out her hand and he shook it. His grip was weak in one finger. She patted Allie on the head,
            told her that she should come visit more. Then they were gone. Ghosts exorcized. Returned to a more natural habitat.
            There at the mouth of the airport she felt restless and heavy.
            <br>
            It took around half an hour to circle the airport to the airfield. There it kept itself separate from her with a tall
            fence with wire barbed about the top. Through the fence she watched the planes; fat things making lazy turns on the
            airfield. Big metal constructed things, cross-like in shape, seeming impossibly heavy and immobile.
            She waited for the plane the two were on to come into view. And there it was. She sat down onto the yellow grass.
            She waited.
            <br>
            Then it began the glacial movement. It rounded the corner. On the runway it arrived and pulled itself back like a sprinter.
            <br>
            She watched the workers in hi-vis neon yellow-orange jackets and vests, watched the little tow cars bustle about the
            ground like rats. She watched from afar the airport and the small dots which signified theoretical people.
            Perhaps mothers, brothers, sisters, fathers. She looked at her watch and turned away, back into her big 1999
            Chevrolet Camaro, back to her workplace in the big city with the big job.
            <br>
            She could not see the bustle of the peoples’ lives. She could not see Allison Wu, slightly drowsy,
            taking out the small flying reptile that was now under her command, and Edward Wu, a little cranky from the journey
            to the winged sardine can, worrying silently about the amount of processed foods his daughter had consumed,
            whose mind was already racing about the sorts of recipes he would have to cook to counteract the detrimental effect
            on her health. And she did not see the departing plane like a small white dove on the horizon.
