            Ding dong.
            <br>
            “Oh! Welcome! Come on in.” Auntie fluttered around the room like a butterfly. The  house was still the same, though it
            had been several months since Priyanka last visited. As Priyanka and her family were taking off their shoes, Auntie
            went to the base of the stairs and yelled, “Aditi! I mean, Adriana!”
            <br>
            “Adriana?” Priyanka wondered, “Who is she?” In many movies Priyanka had seen, the  celebrity always walks down the
            stairs in an elegant dress while her adoring fans wait  eagerly at the bottom. Aditi, or “Adriana,” was no different.
            She wore a long sari, threaded with gold, bejeweled flowers creeping across the fabric. Her hair was curled over
            her shoulder, and large glittering earrings quivered as she walked over.
            <br>
            “Hi, Aditi.” Priyanka waved, toeing the floor shyly.
            <br>
            “Hey, Priyanka. Just to let you know, I go by Adriana now.” As Priyanka attempted  to disguise her embarrassment,
            Adriana tossed her hair over her shoulder (were those  blonde highlights?) and twirled at the bottom of the stairs.
            <br>
            Auntie said tiredly, “Adriana, go with Priyanka upstairs, please.” Priyanka’s parents  walked away with her,
            giving an encouraging smile to Priyanka. Her little brother was  already running up the stairs with his friend,
            Adriana’s younger brother. “So…let’s go.” In a whirl of silk and bling, Adriana began to alight the stairs. Priyanka
            followed nervously, her feet squeaking as they walked towards Adriana’s room. As Adriana carelessly shoved open the
            door, Priyanka stared at the room. They had not talked for a  while, as Priyanka felt that their friendship had been
            declining. During this long period of not  seeing each other, Adriana’s room had undergone many changes.
            Posters of books and  plays were plastered against the purple walls,almost as if to hide them. Chalk was smeared across
            the walls, doodles and unreadable phrases splattered here and there. The little tiles spelling “Aditi” were still there
            but had been drawn on messily with markers. The bed was heaped with dirty clothing, the bedsheets thrown back.
            The one thing that had not changed about Adriana was that she still loved books. This separated her from Priyanka’s
            idea of a “cool kid” (she had read many books about the struggles of being “cool” and imagined a stereotype).
            <br>
            After a few minutes of silence, Adriana attempted a conversation. “So…how’s life?”  Priyanka made a thumbs up,
            and again quiet reigned over the room. Outside the door,  Priyanka could hear the sounds of her brother playing with
            his friend. The conversation  again started as Priyanka asked Adriana how she was, but died away after a few minutes.
            Just as it was picking up speed again, Auntie came into the room and invited them to have some snacks.
            Adriana swept grandly out the room while Priyanka tried not to trip over her long fancy train.
            <br>
            “Would you like some food, sweetheart?” Priyanka’s parents asked her gently.  “There’s some mango lassi.”
            Priyanka nodded mutely, and her mother got her a glass of her  favorite drink, mango lassi.
            As Adriana welcomed her friends from school, Priyanka quietly petted the family dog and gingerly sipped her drink,
            watching as family by family joined the party. Her own family had not expected so many people, for which her parents
            apologized to Priyanka later. But for now, she stared dully out the window, waiting for the time to go home.
            She was suddenly awakened from her listlessness by hearing her name and searched the crowded room for the voice.
            <br>
            “Um, Priyanka?” Adriana called out. “Hey, you wanna come over here?” Priyanka lifted herself up
            sluggishly and walked over to them. After a few minutes of listening about this annoying teacher and that
            ridiculous stunt, she began to pet the dog silently again. “Girls, the puja is starting!” Auntie called out.
            <br>
            “Great,” Priyanka thought. “Yet another way I can embarrass myself.” She had never  been good with following
            religious practices, though when she did try, she made her best effort. As Priyanka was sitting down on the thin
            red blanket, she saw a shy little girl sitting with her mother. The girl’s sister was much bolder than her sibling and
            performed all the rites excitedly while the girl remained curled up in her mother’s lap. The girl reminded Priyanka
            of herself, too shy to participate.
            <br>
            In front of Priyanka was a low table, covered with a matching red blanket. Different  statues and pictures of the
            deities crowded it. A bowl of fruit sat at one end of the table,  while a metal tray sat at the other. Packets of
            rice, powder, and wood sat next to Uncle,  while candles flickered weakly in front of the gods. Music was playing
            in the background (It took a while for Alexa to change from pop to temple music). To Priyanka, this music was
            somewhat familiar: it had never been a large aspect of her life, but it was an inherent part of her. She heard laughs
            behind her and turned. Adriana’s bowl-shaped dress looked like she was being swallowed by a cupcake. All her friends
            were laughing, and her brother was rolling his eyes at her. Uncle scolded her exasperatedly and continued on with the
            preparations.
            <br>
            “Priyanka, place one fruit in front of the gods.” Uncle was busy mixing a red powder  with water to create a bright
            red paste. Priyanka duly lifted herself up, taking care not to  trip on her dress, and placed a fruit in front of the
            gods. When she sat down again, she saw that Adriana and her friends were talking and giggling in the back. Priyanka
            thought that at least she could have pride in knowing she was behaving respectfully in front of the gods and not
            giggling about some kids at school. Uncle handed her a tray of red paste and told her to place it on one of the
            gods. She followed his directions, dipping her finger into the bright red paste and gently placing her fingertip on
            the god’s forehead. After that, she was told to place two rice grains on the sticky red paste. She attempted to do
            so, but the rice fell off in the end, so she sat quietly down, and they proceeded with the prayers. All the other
            kids followed his instructions, though some with more scolding than others. Everyone in the room lined up and, one
            by one, each of them came and lifted the candle, lifting it in a slow circle in front of the gods. Then, they again
            lined up to come and pray. When Adriana went to pray, she had thrown herself onto the floor. With her hair thrown
            over her face, her rumpled sari, and her hands clasped in front of her, she looked like a perfect image of devotion
            to the gods. Priyanka could not help but think of how funny it was that a girl who had not been very respectful
            nor engaged in the prayers could look so devoted.
            <br>
            When it was Priyanka’s turn, she quickly kneeled and prayed, a stream of  incoherent thoughts playing through her head.
            “If the gods ever get this message,” she thought, “they will be very confused.” They all laughed as she bolted away,
            teasing her that her prayers were very short. Priyanka felt slightly stung by these comments, for she had respected
            the puja more than some of the other kids.
            <br>
            When everyone had prayed, Auntie stood up and invited everyone to eat the catered dinner. Priyanka’s parents
            helped her to some food, which she ate quietly. She sat  uncomfortably in the leather chair, watching as the pink
            sky turned sour, its rays turning  to a bitter black night. Her mother talked quietly with anyone who conversed with her,
            though mainly checking in on Priyanka and her brother. Her father was nowhere to be  found, most likely answering a
            phone call outside.
            <br>
            “Everyone, outside!” Uncle called out once everyone had gobbled up the last remnants on their plates.
            Everyone jammed on their shoes and yanked their coats from the  closet, buttoning up against the cold.
            Priyanka skipped down the steps to the porch,  shuddering as the sudden cold permeated her skin. Her brother
            now clung to her family, as Adriana’s brother was talking with his other friends. Some of the kids ran and
            lit up the fireworks, scrambling for their lives away from the squealing boxes. The fireworks were small and
            not very exciting, but they were pretty. As the fireworks shrieked and whined behind them, everyone took long
            sparklers and danced around with them, taking photos of each other. Uncle came up to Priyanka and encouraged her
            to light a firework. She first hesitated but then took the lighter and placed it carefully onto the firework box and
            scurried out of harm’s way.
            <br>
            “Well,” she thought, “That wasn’t so bad.” Soon, everyone raced inside, relaxing as  the heat from the house thawed their
            frozen fingers. Priyanka’s father offered her some ras malai, but she was too shy and tired to accept any, even though
            she loved it. Adriana had changed into jeans and a button-up shirt, chatting with her friends. After a while, Priyanka
            and her family were in the car, driving back home.
            <br>
            “I’m so sorry, I didn’t know there would be so many people…” Priyanka’s mother  apologized, but Priyanka did not
            blame her. It had been her own choice to go to the party, but Priyanka was beginning to think that perhaps Adriana’s
            and her friendship was too weak now to salvage.
            <br>
            “It’s okay, Mommy. Aditi, I mean Adriana is so different. Different name, different  hair, different room.”
            <br>
            “Well, people change, I suppose.” Priyanka’s mother said, turning at the green  stoplight. Priyanka’s father then
            proceeded to tease everyone, at which Priyanka’s brother shoved him away. Her parents complimented her brother,
            who had been considered the best-behaved boy out of the rowdy bunch of them. The whole family was very happy to be home.
            They ran up the stairs, left their fancy Indian clothes on the bench, and rushed to their own rooms. Priyanka plopped
            onto her bed, happy that the day was over. Then she realized that school was tomorrow and panicked for a moment before
            realizing that she had no homework. Her parents knocked softly on the door and told her how proud they were that she
            tried to reconnect with her old friend.
            <br>
            “I guess today wasn’t so bad. Friends grow apart. I have happy memories when we were friends, though, and that’s what
            matters,” she thought. As the door shut and the  hall light flickered off, Priyanka fell asleep smiling,
            remembering a day years ago when she  had met a girl named Aditi…
            <br>
            <br>
            The End (Happy Diwali!)
